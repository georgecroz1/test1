        <P class="pagewrap"> Unknown:
            "Welcome Fugative, <br> <br>
        you have been hired by an unknown criminal organization to take on a very important job. <br> <br>
        We have been tracking down a specific CIT (Cash In Transit) business for a while and it appears, while on route 
        to their final destination their van was ambushed and hijacked resulting in barrels of money getting stolen. <br> <br>
        However, one barrel was not taken and it remains unlocated to this day.
        We have confirmation that CIT is hiding the location of the ambush within their computers system files.
        You must infiltrate their system and find the location of that money. <br> <br>
        Do whatever it takes, we don't have much time. Good luck."
